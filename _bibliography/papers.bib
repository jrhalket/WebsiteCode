  year     = {2023},
  abstract = {We document large systematic variations in the return to single-family residential property within U.S. metropolitan areas. Areas with low income, low credit scores or high shares of black residents have higher yields and therefore higher returns. Yield spreads between low credit areas and high credit areas widened considerably during periods when the opportunity cost of credit widened most for low credit borrowers. The relationship between the local cost of credit and local expected returns also causes the areas with higher returns to also have higher risk, in sample. However we argue that the excess return that some areas earn is not purely compensation for bearing extra risk but is rather evidence for segmented housing markets where different local discount rates price local assets.},

  abstract = {We use archaeological data from ancient settlements of three different historical eras on a Greek island to construct novel measures of consumption. Using these, we show that the shares of high-quality consumption goods were relatively more concentrated closer to the center of nucleated settlements as compared to low-quality consumption goods. There is no such pattern in a placebo settlement. In this unique setting, these quality gradients may reflect differences in household consumption baskets across these settlements. We argue that some alternative, trade or production based hypotheses for such gradients can be weakly ruled out based on our data and archaeological sources.},

  abstract  = {Which housing characteristics are important for understanding homeownership rates? How are housing characteristics priced in rental and owner‐occupied markets? What can answers to these questions tell us about economic theories of homeownership? Using the English Housing Survey, we estimate a selection model of property allocations to the owner‐occupied and rental sectors. Structural characteristics and unobserved quality are important for selection. Location is not. Accounting for selection is important for rent‐to‐price ratio estimates and explains some puzzling correlations between rent‐to‐price ratios and homeownership rates. These patterns are consistent with, among others, hypotheses of rental market contracting frictions related to housing maintenance.},

  abstract = {The provision of owner-occupied versus rental houses is modeled as a competitive search economy where households have private information over their expected duration. With public information, households with low vacancy hazard rates pay lower rents and search in thicker rental markets. With private information, rentals are under-provided to long-duration households to discourage short-duration households from searching there. Ownership is attractive in part because it cures the private information problem. Using a novel data set of rental listings, we show that homeownership rates are high where rent-to-price ratios are low but rentals are scarce and that long-duration households sort into scarce rental markets. These patterns are consistent with the model only under private information.},

  abstract  = {Are households more likely to be homeowners when “housing risk” is higher? We show that home‐ownership rates and loan‐to‐value (LTV) ratios at the city level are strongly negatively correlated with local house price volatility. However, causal inference is confounded by house price levels, which are systematically correlated with housing risk in an intuitive way\{:} in cities where the land value is larger relative to the local cost of structures, house prices are higher and more volatile. We disentangle the contributions of high price levels from high volatilities by building a life‐cycle model of home‐ownership choices. We find that higher price levels can explain most of the lower home‐ownership. Higher risk in the model leads to slightly lower home‐ownership and LTV ratios in high land value cities. The relationship between LTV and risk is corroborated by LTV's negative correlation with price volatility in the data and highlights the importance of including other means of incomplete insurance in models of home‐ownership.},

While some households rent due to borrowing constraints in the mortgage market, factors that affect propensities to save and move, such as risky house values and transactions costs, are equally important determinants of the ownership rate.},
