We document large systematic variations in the return to property within U.S. metropolitan areas. Areas with low income, low credit scores or high shares of non-white residents have higher yields and therefore higher returns. The spreads between low credit areas and high credit areas widened considerably during a period when credit availability was low. We argue that this is evidence for segmented housing markets where local discount rates price different local  assets.
