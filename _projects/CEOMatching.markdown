Empirically, executive compensation is linked to various measures of firm performance, not just stock returns. Different firms uses different measures to attract heterogeneously talented managers. In order to quantify the role that heterogenous measures play in both optimally incentivizing executives and optimally allocating talent, we build and estimate a model of manager compensation which nests optimal contracting within a matching model.
